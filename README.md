<h1>üëë Rules of Chess </h1>


- 1Ô∏è‚É£ The chessboard consists of 64 squares arranged in an 8x8 grid.
- 2Ô∏è‚É£ Each player starts with 16 pieces: 1 king, 1 queen, 2 rooks, 2 knights, 2 bishops, and 8 pawns.
- 3Ô∏è‚É£ The objective is to checkmate the opponent's king, which means the king is in a position to be captured (check) with no legal moves to escape.
- 4Ô∏è‚É£ Each piece moves in a specific way:
- üëë King: One square in any direction.
- ‚ôõ Queen: Any number of squares in any direction (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).
- ‚ôú Rook: Any number of squares horizontally or vertically.
- ‚ôû Knight: Moves in an L-shape: two squares in one direction (horizontally or vertically) and then one square in a perpendicular direction.
- ‚ôù Bishop: Any number of squares diagonally.
- ‚ôüÔ∏è Pawn: Moves forward one square, but captures diagonally. On its initial move, it can move two squares forward. Pawns also have special moves like en passant and promotion.
- 5Ô∏è‚É£ Pieces can capture opponents' pieces by moving to their squares, except for the knight, which jumps over other pieces.
- 6Ô∏è‚É£ The game begins with white playing first, and players take turns moving their pieces.
- 7Ô∏è‚É£ Special moves include castling (moving the king and rook together) and en passant (capturing an opponent's pawn that has moved two squares forward).
- 8Ô∏è‚É£ If a player's king is under attack (in check), they must move their king out of check, block the attack, or capture the attacking piece.
- 9Ô∏è‚É£ If a player's king is in checkmate and cannot escape capture, the game is over, and the opposing player wins.
- üîü The game can also end in a draw with stalemate, threefold repetition, insufficient material, or the 50-move rule.
